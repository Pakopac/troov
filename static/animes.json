What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","genres":["action","military","mystery","super power","drama","fantasy","shounen"],"members":2066328,"rating":8.44,"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347.jpg","producer":"Wit Studio","episodes":25,"source":"Manga","end_time":"Apr 7, 2013, 01:58 (JST)","category":"Action"},{"title":"Sword Art Online","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online","abstract":"In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched.

He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players.
