It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\r\n\r\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.\r\n\r\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","genres":["action","adventure","comedy","super power","drama","fantasy","shounen"],"members":1110526,"rating":8.48,"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73245.jpg","producer":"Toei Animation","episodes":null,"source":"Manga","end_time":"Oct 20, 1999, 09:30 (JST)","category":"Action"},{"id":24,"title":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann","abstract":"Simon and Kamina were born and raised in a deep, underground village, hidden from the fabled surface.
